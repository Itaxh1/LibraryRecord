**Project: Library Content Management with Node.js, MongoDB, and RabbitMQ**
This project extends a Node.js/Express API to handle library content uploads (e.g., PDF files, eBooks, etc.) and process additional metadata or previews via an offline workflow using RabbitMQ. It demonstrates how to integrate file uploads, store digital content on the server, track metadata in a MongoDB database, and use a background worker to generate and store useful previews or summaries for the uploaded files.

**Key Features**
Multipart Library Content Uploads
Accepts various file formats (e.g., PDF, EPUB) via a POST /contents endpoint.
Validates and rejects unsupported file types.
Stores metadata (e.g., bookId, description) in MongoDB.
Content Storage & Retrieval
Saves original uploaded files in the server filesystem with appropriate extensions.
Provides download URLs (e.g., /media/contents/{filename}.pdf) in API responses so clients can retrieve the original files.
Offline Metadata/Preview Generation
The API server publishes a message to a RabbitMQ queue each time new library content is uploaded.
A separate RabbitMQ consumer processes these tasks, generating a preview, summary, or relevant metadata for the uploaded file using appropriate Node.js libraries.
The generated previews (e.g., cover thumbnails, text snippets) are stored in a separate directory, and their paths are recorded in MongoDB under the original content record.
Clients can download these previews via URLs like /media/previews/{filename}.png (or another appropriate extension).
Scalable Microservices Architecture
Use RabbitMQ to decouple the main API from potentially heavy processing tasks.
Add more consumers to handle large loads of content processing in parallel.
Store all metadata in MongoDB for quick lookups, even as your library grows.
Docker & Docker Compose (Optional Enhancement)
Simplify deployment by containerizing all components (API server, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, and the consumer process).
A single command (docker-compose up) can spin up the entire library management ecosystem, including any health checks or volume sharing needed for file storage.
